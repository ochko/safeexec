safeexec (safe execution environment)
A general-purpose lightweight sandbox for safely executing user programs

safeexec provides a sandbox environment which prevents
malicious users from causing trouble, and user mistakes from blowing up
your server. However, running code on your server should be taken at 
__your own risk__. 

You should take these additional precautions:
- check whether safeexec default gid (1000)/uids (10000-42768) are in use!
- this code doesn't block network access. Use iptables to do this, e.g.:
   /sbin/iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --gid-owner 1000 -j DROP
- the max number of file handles (nfile) needs to be nonzero in order to
  read libraries, but even if the maximum file size (fsize) is 0, the code
  can go around creating size-0 files. Use file permissions to avoid this,
  and to avoid reads as well. Chroot can limit how much of a "file system"
  they can see at all.

The general plan:
- fork into two processes
- safeexec should have its setuid bit on, and uid root
- one fork will be a supervisor running as root
- other fork runs program as unprivileged user, with rlimits & nice
- supervisor will measure total memory by looking in /proc/
- wall clock limit enforced with alarm() & signal()
- return EXIT_SUCCESS (0) if all went ok, EXIT_FAILURE otherwise

Standard input to safeexec is passed on to the exec'd process.

The non-supervisor user number is determined by the supervisor process:

  <non-supervisor uid #> = 10000 + <supervisor pid #>

or, you can replace 10000 with something else using uidplus.
Since pids are unique, so are the resulting uids.
  (Sanity check: max value of pids is in /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max)
Among other things, this should prevent simultaneous safeexec'ed
programs from kill()ing each other, which they could do if they had
the same user id.

INSTALLATION, EXAMPLE

make amonkeyoutofme (requires sudo access)

./safeexec (displays full list of options)

./safeexec --memory 50000 --exec hello-world 
(run the executable hello-world with a memory limit of 50000k)

USAGE NOTES AND TROUBLESHOOTING

Chroot is powerful stuff: it makes a given directory (say, /jail)
appear to be the root directory of the file system, as far as 
the child process can see. However, the jail directory might
need to be given further files, in order for the child process
to operate correctly. For example, a Python3 jail needs to include
some unexpected things like /lib/libcrypt-2.5.so.

Make sure that you set the file and memory limits big enough that
your language can load. Python can give you all manner of strange 
errors if it doesn't get enough memory. 

PARANOID DISCLAIMER

You can get more fine-grained supervision if you ptrace, which
interrupts every system call (at a cost of more overhead). Use
a VM if you are more paranoid. Use separate machines if you want
to avoid timing attacks.
